Makefile has comments to help you figure out your own Makefile.


hex.c is an example of a C program using an ADT.  The ADT is iohelp.
Notice that iohelp.h contains all the specifications for the ADT
and is #included in hex.c.

I do NOT recommend that you use iohelp but instead learn the standard
C library functions fopen, fclose, fgets, sscandf, strdup and strtok_r.
The setup here is to provide an example Makefile and an example of
an ADT setup in C.
