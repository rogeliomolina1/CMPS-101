#When run, the scc03 program will go through the following sequence:
#
#The program reads and interprets the command-line parameters
#then opens the input file and loads input into the graph.
#Then the program converts the array of adjacency lists to
#the 2-D adjacency matrix.
#
#Then the program prints the graph.
#Also when n <= 12 vertices it prints the adjacency matrix.
#
#To compute SCCs, main calls findSCCs() which calls the main subroutines dfsTrace1(),
#transposeGraph(), dfsPhase2(), as well as calling the printing functions after each Trace.

#When the program is run with test1.txt and as directed the output is given below
